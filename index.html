                <h1>Welcome to Edens Zero world!</h1>
                    <div>Shiki is a boy who's always dreamed of making new friends from outside the Granbell Kingdom, 
                        his amusement park home filled with robots. He gets his wish when two young adventurers Rebecca and her talking blue cat, 
                        Happy come looking for interesting things to record for their B-Cube channel. So begins the tale of Shiki Granbell,
                        who learns the world beyond Granbell is far bigger than he could have possibly imagined.
                        After escaping from Norma and returning to their time with two new companions — a younger version of Professor Weisz, 
                        and an amnesiac android called E.M. Pino—Shiki and co. have learned the truth of the planet's true fate from the present Weisz: 
                        that fifty years of Norma's original time was eaten by a Chronophage. Meanwhile, they are captured by the notorious space pirate Elsie Crimson 
                        on her battleship, the Skull Fairy. Shiki challenges her to a duel in order to take her ship for himself, but will he succeed, or fall to the strong 
                        opponent who claims she will surpass the Demon King?</div>
